By creating progressively more complex simulations of our world, I hope to gain a better understanding of how to translate physics equations into computer algorithms. I'll initially be using python, since I'd like to get better at python and can take advantage of the many game/simulation modules.

2D Ball: learned pygame basics, modeled object movement and gravity, collision with walls, how to use keys to control something
2D Cannon: drew a cannon with GIMP, learned how to set timed events, modeled friction
2D Ball Collisions: learned buttons in pygame, applied OOP, modeled ball collisions using trigonometry, decomposing velocity into normal and tangential components, and swapped normal vectors to compute the elastic collisions.
Spring Mass Damper: created oscillating mass/spring/damper animation using Hookes law and simple Euler integration, also used matplotlib to plot acceleration, velocity, and position of mass over time
